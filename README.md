#Project Updates

Last Updated: 3/8

We are modifying this template to conduct a data analysis project assessing various nursing home characteristics with each nursing home's rate of healthcare associated infections. We will utilize two publicly available datasets for this analysis. 

Part 1: For more information and project part 1 - see manuscript file. 

Part 2: For more information about data wrangling, see the processing code readme and Quarto files. For some more information about the   exploratory analysis see the analysis_code subfolder read me and Quarto files. 

Part 3: If you want to know what my project is all about - start with reading the abstract under the manuscript section. From there, if you want to know what I have done so far you can view my code folder. The processed code folder should walk you through my code processing steps and compiling of two disparate data sources. Next up, in the analysis folder you can find my code for analyzing the data. The quarto files should load a nice page in your browser that show my findings to date. 

I hope this works!!
