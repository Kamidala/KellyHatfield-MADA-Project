Part 1: Project Overview

Data Overview
      
      For this project I will utilize data collected and aggregated by the Centers for Medicare Services (CMS) for all CMS certified nursing homes throughout the United States. The data are accessed here: https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/archived-data/nursing-homes. There are approximately 15,000 CMS certified nursing homes throughout the US, so we will have a large geographically diverse population to study. 

For this analysis I will be combining two files: 
      
      The provider information file contains general information on currently active nursing homes, including number of certified beds, quality measure scores, staffing and other information used in the Five-Star Rating System. Data are presented as one row per nursing home. 
    
    The second file will contain data aggreated for the Skilled Nursing Facility Quality Reporting Program. CMS aggregates data from the over 15,000 certified nursing homes for a number of quality metrics. They provide these metrics on their Care Compare Website. 
      
      Detailed infromation about the various QRP metrics can be found on CMS technical appendix page: https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Quality-Initiatives- Patient-Assessment-Instruments/NursingHomeQualityInits/Skilled-Nursing-Facility-Quality-Reporting- Program/SNF-Quality-Reporting-Program-Measures-and-Technical-Information. 
     
      The primary QRP metric of interest for this study will be S_039_01: Percentage of  patients who acquired a healthcare-associated infection during their SNF stay that resulted in hospitalization. This metric is derived entirely from fee-for-service Medicare claims data and relatively new, as it has only been publicly reported since late 2022.  This percentage is shown both as the observed rate and as the risk standardized rate. CMS also reports if this rate is as expected, significantly worse than expected, or significantly better compared to all other nursing homes in that time period. 
  
Data Analysis
      
      The prposed study aims to assess various nursing home characteristics for association with healthcare-associated infection rates. 
      
      First, we will provide a descriptive analysis of nursing homes across the United States including location, bed size, ownership, average number of residents per day. Specifically of interest, we will also describe variability in overall quality ratings, the healthcare-associated infection quality reporting measure, and measures of staffing (including various levels of nursing care (i.e., RN, LPN, and aide)  both aggregated and separately). 
      Second, we will utilize ANOVA methods to determine which, if any,  average staffing characteristics are associated with the classifications of HAI rates as “better”, “worse”, or “as expected”.  
      Third, we will assess a variety of nursing home characteristics and selected staffing measures for associations with  the risk adjusted rate of HAIs in the nursing home. 
      

The structure below is one possible setup for a data analysis project (including the course project). For a manuscript, adjust as needed. 
You don't need to have exactly these sections, but the content covering those sections should be addressed.

This uses MS Word as output format. [See here](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/ms-word.html) for more information. You can switch to other formats, like html or pdf. See [the Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/) for other formats.

# Summary/Abstract
_Write a summary of your project._


{{< pagebreak >}}


# Introduction 

## General Background Information
_Provide enough background on your topic that others can understand the why and how of your analysis_ 

## Description of data and data source
_Describe what the data is, what it contains, where it is from, etc. Eventually this might be part of a methods section._

## Questions/Hypotheses to be addressed
_State the research questions you plan to answer with this analysis._

To cite other work (important everywhere, but likely happens first in introduction), make sure your references are in the bibtex file specified in the YAML header above (here `dataanalysis_template_references.bib`) and have the right bibtex key. Then you can include like this:

Examples of reproducible research projects can for instance be found in [@mckay2020; @mckay2020a]

# Methods 

_Describe your methods. That should describe the data, the cleaning processes, and the analysis approaches. You might want to provide a shorter description here and all the details in the supplement._


## Data aquisition
_As applicable, explain where and how you got the data. If you directly import the data from an online source, you can combine this section with the next._


## Data import and cleaning
_Write code that reads in the file and cleans it so it's ready for analysis. Since this will be fairly long code for most datasets, it might be a good idea to have it in one or several R scripts. If that is the case, explain here briefly what kind of cleaning/processing you do, and provide more details and well documented code somewhere (e.g. as supplement in a paper). All materials, including files that contain code, should be commented well so everyone can follow along._


## Statistical analysis
_Explain anything related to your statistical analyses._

# Results

## Exploratory/Descriptive analysis

_Use a combination of text/tables/figures to explore and describe your data. Show the most important descriptive results here. Additional ones should go in the supplement. Even more can be in the R and Quarto files that are part of your project._


@tbl-summarytable shows a summary of the data.

Note the loading of the data providing a **relative** path using the `../../` notation. (Two dots means a folder up). You never want to specify an **absolute** path like `C:\ahandel\myproject\results\` because if you share this with someone, it won't work for them since they don't have that path. You can also use the `here` R package to create paths. See examples of that below.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-summarytable
#| tbl-cap: "Data summary table."
#| echo: FALSE
resulttable=readRDS("../../results/summarytable.rds")
knitr::kable(resulttable)
```



## Basic statistical analysis

_To get some further insight into your data, if reasonable you could compute simple statistics (e.g. simple models with 1 predictor) to look for associations between your outcome(s) and each individual predictor variable. Though note that unless you pre-specified the outcome and main exposure, any "p<0.05 means statistical significance" interpretation is not valid._


@fig-result shows a scatterplot figure produced by one of the R scripts.

```{r}
#| label: fig-result
#| fig-cap: "Height and weight stratified by gender."
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("results","height_weight_stratified.png"))
```


## Full analysis

_Use one or several suitable statistical/machine learning methods to analyze your data and to produce meaningful figures, tables, etc. This might again be code that is best placed in one or several separate R scripts that need to be well documented. You want the code to produce figures and data ready for display as tables, and save those. Then you load them here._

Example @tbl-resulttable2 shows a summary of a linear model fit.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-resulttable2
#| tbl-cap: "Linear model fit table."
#| echo: FALSE
resulttable2 = readRDS(here("results","resulttable2.rds"))
knitr::kable(resulttable2)
```

# Discussion

## Summary and Interpretation
_Summarize what you did, what you found and what it means._

## Strengths and Limitations
_Discuss what you perceive as strengths and limitations of your analysis._

## Conclusions
_What are the main take-home messages?_

_Include citations in your Rmd file using bibtex, the list of references will automatically be placed at the end_

This paper [@leek2015] discusses types of analyses. 

These papers [@mckay2020; @mckay2020a] are good examples of papers published using a fully reproducible setup similar to the one shown in this template. 

Note that this cited reference will show up at the end of the document, the reference formatting is determined by the CSL file specified in the YAML header. Many more style files for almost any journal [are available](https://www.zotero.org/styles). You also specify the location of your bibtex reference file in the YAML. You can call your reference file anything you like, I just used the generic word `references.bib` but giving it a more descriptive name is probably better.
