This folder contains data accessed from data.cms.gov (https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/archived-data/nursing-homes). 

Data were downloaded from the February release of 2023 Annual Files. 
We included NH_ProviderInfo. This table provides one row for each nursing home in the Untied States and contains aggregate summary information. 

The Skilled_Nursing_Facility_Quality_Reporting_Program_Provider_Data includes metrics collected by CMS. 

These datasets are linkable on provider identification number. 

The data dictionary is attached in a pdf form. 

This raw data-set should generally not be edited by hand. It should instead be loaded and processed/cleaned using code.
