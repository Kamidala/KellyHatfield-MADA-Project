Hello! Thanks for reading me. 

In order to replicate this analysis, you can access the raw data and processing code in the processing_code file. You will see here we joined two disparate data sources for this analysis. One contains information on nursing home infection rates and the other contains information on nursing home characteristics and staffing rates. 

Our analytic dataset is saved in the processed_data folder. 

You can use the analytic code in the analysis_code file to replicate my analyses.
