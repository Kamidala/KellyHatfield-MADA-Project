This folder contains code to do some simple analysis on the processed/cleaned data.


Exploratory data analysis is a Quarto file which does some exploratory data analysis by creating a few tables and figures.

We are starting to look at the distribution of the HAI rates as well as the distribution of the staffing variables. We also are exploring other potentially important variables like nursing home ownership. Finally, we do some model building to determine the best model for assessing the association of nursing home staffing rates per resident per day and HAI rates. 

Analysis for paper is a Quarto file that creates all the numbers, figures, and tables included in teh final analysis. This should be used to recreate the analysis in the manuscript.
